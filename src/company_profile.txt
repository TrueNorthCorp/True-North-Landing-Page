TRUE NORTH Maritime Corporation started its full operation last August 1997. The Company was organized to undertake the comprehensive handling of different kinds of ocean going vessels. It has evolved into a dynamic creativity and spirited core group of experienced professionals from the fields of management, navigation, and engineering in maritime business and employees who have held strategic positions from well-known manning and shipping agencies.
TRUE NORTH subscribe to the ideas that crew management and the running of vessels require seasoned personnel both ashore and onboard and that manning is the most important component of full ship management.
Presently, we crew manage a fleet comprising of general cargo, semi-container, bulk carrier and oil / chemical tanker vessels. As crew managers, we perform all customary functions related to crewing and ensure that the vessel is properly complemented and manned by fully trained certified, qualified, well-experienced and medically fit officers and ratings.
We are committed in maintaining our policy of good/personnel relationship which is well known to most seafarers as TRUE NORTH believes that people who enjoy their employer will do a better job and are willing to give their utmost in terms of their work capability. At the wheel of TRUE NORTH is Capt. DANILO I. ACENAS, the manager, a Master Marine himself.
